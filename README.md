# Java-Learning
In this repo, you will be able to see me go from zero java experience, so actually knowing what I am doing.
These projects are my classwork from three semesters worth of java.

The first semester was very structured, and only focused on the basics.

The second semester, the class worked on whatever the instructor came up with, while maintaining a focus on learning some of the more advanced concepts.

The third semester, the course was very structured. We were expected to learn advanced comcepts on our own from that point, and were given complicated problems to solve. All the projects used test driven development, and we were required to integrate our classes and methods with the APIs that were provided by the instructor. It was very challenging, but I learned a lot. We were required to comment our code, and the entire class was designed to simulate an enterprize environment.
